# Cyclic rotation

# An array A consisting of N integers is given.
# Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index,
# and the last element of the array is moved to the first place.
# For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
# (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).
#
# The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.
# Write a function:
# that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.
#
# For example, given
#
#     A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
#     K = 3
# the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:
#
#     [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
#     [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
#     [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
# For another example, given
#
#     A = [0, 0, 0]
#     K = 1
# the function should return [0, 0, 0]
#
# Given
#     A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
#     K = 4
# the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]
#
# Assume that:
# N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
# In your solution, focus on correctness.
# The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
